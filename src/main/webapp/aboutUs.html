<li>Computer Systems Engineering</li><br>
<li>Computer Science</li><br>

Because Silicon Valley continually demands a multitude of electronics, computer, and business professionals, SNU aims to prepare individuals to achieve the proficiency necessary for quality work in the high-technology industry. Silicon Valley's most pressing needs are for hardware and software design engineers, software application specialists, networking experts, managers trained in the application of computers to business, and business personnel familiar with entrepreneurship and venture business management. While training students to meet these needs quickly, NPU's emphasis is on quality and integrity in the education.<br><br>

SNU provides a unique educational culture and learning environment for students because SNU has been able to attract a strong pool of talented individuals from Silicon Valley to teach, conduct research, and provide student services. The abundance of talent and technical resources in Silicon Valley has also provided NPU with a unique student body. A significant percentage of the student population already works in high-tech industries, which makes the teaching and learning even more interesting.<br><br>

SNU intends to continue to keep abreast of the fast-paced changes in the high-tech industries and at the same time to provide students with a rigorous educational experience.
